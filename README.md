# Sudoku-Solver
This is a program that attempts to solve a Sudoku puzzle passed in as a 2-D array. It modifies the array to become the solved Sudoku puzzle and returns true if the puzzle is solvable. If not, it returns false.

The ultimate goal is to turn this Sudoku Solver into an interactive application using GUI where the user is presented with an empty Sudoku board. The user can then input numbers so that it matches a Sudoku puzzle they are struggling to solve and click a "Solve" puzzle. The Sudoku puzzle will then solve the puzzle by plugging in numbers and either return a "Solved" or "Error: Puzzle is not solvable" message based on the outcome of the algorithm.
